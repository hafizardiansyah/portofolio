        I’m a Frontend Engineer with over 7 years of hands-on experience
        building smooth, modern, and reliable web applications. I’ve worked on
        many types of projects — from internal corporate systems to full-scale
        production apps — and I’m comfortable jumping into both new builds and
        existing codebases.
